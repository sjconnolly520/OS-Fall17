        Syscallhandler
            calss the appropriate element out of the array
            if valid, syscall calls nullsys

        change parameters in handlers. currently int dev, int unit  ---->>> should be int dev, (void *) arg
            instead of casting to an int, cast to a long because size of (     int == 4, long == 8, ptr == 8    )

If time:
            Change Mailbox to have only a single blocklist.
