Requests were not added to queue because DiskWrite was not written..

Simple printDiskRequestList function written.

diskWrite() was calling diskReadReal().
    Changed to diskWriteReal();

diskReadReal() & diskWriteReal() error checking altered.
    Now allow for startSector == 0, startTrack == 0

Find/Remove "Hello"






Questions for Dr. Homer:
   - When we excede the number of tracks on the disk, do we seek to the next track on the disk?
        Test13 does not appear to seek to the next track
        Page 2, diskReadReal: After reading last sector in the track, it should read the first sector in the next track
